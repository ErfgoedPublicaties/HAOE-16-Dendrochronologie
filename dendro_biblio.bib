Tree-ring series of European   oaks (Quercus robur and Q. petraea) have provided a reliable framework   for chronometric dating and reconstruction of past climate and   environment. To date, long oak chronologies cover almost the entire   Holocene, up to 8480 BC and the network over the entire area in which   the two oaks grow is being improved. We present the main characteristics   of oak ring series and discuss the latest methodological advances in   defining the calendar year in which the tree-rings were formed and in   interpreting such dating in terms of the age of a wooden object.   Dendrochronology has established itself as a standard dating tool and   has been applied in a wide variety of (pre-)historical studies.   Archaeological wood, historical buildings, works of art (such as panel   paintings and sculptures) have been successfully investigated. Recent   advances in dendro-provenancing have helped to obtain more information   on the timber trade in the past. Information on past forest structures,   silviculture and timber use have become available through scrutinizing   historical and contemporary ring-width patterns. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Since the middle of the 1980s, dendrochronological analyses of panel paintings produced in the former Netherlands have demonstrated the near-exclusive use of oak from the Baltic region. Further, as Hillam and Tyers [1995. Reliability and repeatability in dendrochronological analysis: tests using the Fletcher archive of panel-painting data. Archaeometry 37 (2), 395-405] did for English paintings analyzed by Fletcher, the objective of the present work was to determine whether it was possible to distinguish different Baltic typologies in the wood used for paintings in the ancient Southern Netherlands from 1450 AD to 1650 AD. In this study, it appeared that the same three "English" typologies (BALTIC1, BALTIC2 and BALTIC3) were also found in the Southern Netherlands, in proportions varying by period. The diversity of Baltic typologies in England was interpreted by Hillam and Tyers (1995) as reflecting changes in the procurement sources for wood. In addition to this diversification of Baltic typologies in the Southern Netherlands, a Western European provenance was identified for 16\% of the wood used in Flemish panels. The research focused on determination of the provenance of these non-Baltic oaks, by comparison between wood from painting panels and site chronologies for all of Belgium, the northern half of France and southwest Germany. Such comparison yielded a network of good correlations between the panel ring series and site chronologies along the Franco-Belgian Meuse and the French Moselle River. Dendrochronological dates obtained for the Flemish panels in the corpus clarify the period during which diversification of Baltic sources intensified. The parallel between the very high proportion of BALTIC1 type woods in Flemish panels before 1565 AD, and its progressive decrease until complete disappearance in the 1620 AD, and quantitative data from the Sound Toll Records, among others, led to interpret the BALTIC1 typology as representing the enormous hinterland exploited by the Gdansk port, the principal place of export for wood until 1565 AD. This port then decreased in importance until its disappearance at the beginning of the 17th century. Oaks closest to BALTIC2 and BALTIC3 types reflect the percentage of exports lost to the Gdansk competitors. The period of increase in the use of oaks of BALTIC2 and BALTIC3 typologies also coincides with the appearance of the use of Meuse/Moselle oaks. Explanations for these changes are in relationship to the politico-economic and religious contexts, in particular the wars of religion starting in the 1560 AD that destabilized Europe, and the separation of Northern and Southern Netherlands in 1585 AD.

	abstract = {GREEN VETERANS. LIVING WITNESSES OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR.
A veteran tree is “a tree which, because of its great age, size or condition, is of exceptional cultural, landscape or nature conservation value”. A veteran is also defined as a ‘former soldier’. In Flanders Fields, both terms are closely linked. The landscape and local vegetation in and nearby the Ypres salient was mutilated during the First World War. By the end of the war, a treeless landscape remained with only a few standing dead trunks along the horizon. As a consequence one would not expect to find trees in this region over a hundred years old.
The military operations on the battlefield fueled a constant demand for timber, what also led to an intensive deforestation in the local landscape. Soon, forests in France were of most strategic importance to the allied troops as they were the main source for timber. Two special regiments, the 10th and 20th engineers Forestry of the U.S. Army, were brought together to organize and manage the timber supplies. Also for everyday activities, as cooking and heating massive amounts of firewood were needed. In the trenches thousands of braziers were fueled with wood, charcoal or coal, depending on what was available. Most probably, the numerous pollards and coppiced trees in the landscape surrounding Ypres and Poperinge must have been a welcome source for firewood.
In the line of fire, trees and entire forests were eliminated by the exploding ammunition. A tree can easily survive a single hit by a bullet, as they are ‘programmed’ to compartmentalize and overgrow the wound. However, a direct hit by a larger explosive can eliminate an entire tree at once. But trees themselves were strategically important. Not only they could serve as a lookout, but also as a hide for a marksman. However, due to ongoing deforestation of the battlegrounds, this strategic opportunity became increasingly rare. One of the Special Companies of the Royal Engineers was equipped to make replicas of trees in metal and camouflage fabrics. Such fake ‘camouflage trees’ then replaced the original tree and were used as an observation post.
Behind the trenches, the remaining forests served as a resting place for the soldiers. Often medical facilities were organized nearby. An example is the ‘Helleketelbos’, located southwest of Poperinge. To date, within this forest oak trees can be found that are 166 and196 years old, based on tree-ring analysis. The largest oak tree is estimated to be about 245 years old. Such trees have witnessed and survived the First World War. One of these survivors even has a gun barrel protruding its bark. Similar centenarian trees can be found in the Sixtusbossen and Galgebossen, a group of small forests located nearby the former battle zone of the Ypres salient. These ‘veteran’ trees are not in demand by timber traders as it is known the trunks contain a lot of metal and discolorations, and are therefore not marketable. A good example of such a tree with embedded relics of the First World War is an oak that grew near the castle of Elverdinge. After the tree died off in 1995, a cross-section of the trunk was polished and examined. Wounds made by exploding ammunition became clearly visible and dated by means of its tree-rings, to the winter of 1917/18. This cross-section of the dead oak tree is now part of the exhibition in the In Flanders Fields Museum, and serves as an example of the last surviving witnesses of the First World War. Furthermore it demonstrates that ‘veteran’ trees might be a more common feature in today’s landscape in the Ypres area as previously thought.},
